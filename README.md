#### Django/React Demo Project

### What does this do?
As an exercise, I decided to build a Trello like web application using Next.js on the client, and Django REST framework for the API.

### Why do this? 
To explore a few areas that are new to me:
- API's with Django REST
- Drag and drop UI's with React
- Firebase Auth as a 3rd party authentication provider.
