#### Django/React Demo Project

The purpose of this application and repository is to demonstrate Django REST Framework alongside React.
I have not used Django REST up until now, so interested to explore it. I decided to build a Trello like client
application in React to interact with API, as part of this project I also wanted to explore drag and drop UI interactions and how this works.
